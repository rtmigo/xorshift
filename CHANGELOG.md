  of the library

- Updated documentation

# 0.5.1

- fixed: the case of generating zero by 64-bit generators

# 0.4.0

- nextFloat() method now uses more accurate type of conversion

- added RandomBase32.nextInt64()

- nextDoubleMemcast() renamed to nextDoubleBitcast()

- fixed: nextInt() results were not uniform
